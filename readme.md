# Sample Repo

## Practice
I think that we can practice making our own branches, changes to files, etc. here! 

Let's:
1. Create our own branch of the repo with the naming convention **firstname-branch** (so mine would be sara-branch)
2. Add an **About Me** section to the readme.md file
3. Push our changes up to our branches
4. Merge branches into main
